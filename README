<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This application allows you to manage the updates of your applications. It's possible to automatically retrieve the installed version of the software (through the API) and the latest github release.

A changelog system allows you to keep the history of the updates. 

An integration with [GLPI](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi) is possible to automatically open tickets, make follow-up and close it.

Authentication can be done locally or with LDAP.

This project is still in developpement and not prod ready.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* PHP >= 7.2 (PDO, MBstring, Tokenizer, GD, MySQL, SimpleXML & DOM, ldap, curl)
* MySQL >= 5.6
* Git Version Control
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)



### Installation
 
Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/UpperM/patchtracking/patchtracking.git --branch release --single-branch
```

``cd`` into the application folder and run ``composer install --no-dev``

Copy the ``.env.example`` file to ``.env`` and fill with your own database and mail details.

Ensure the storage, ``bootstrap/cache`` & ``public/uploads`` folders are writable by the web server.

In the application root, Run ``php artisan key:generate`` to generate a unique application key.

Set the web root on your server to point to the PatchTracking public folder. This is done with the ``root`` setting on Nginx or the ``DocumentRoot`` setting on Apache.

Run ``php artisan migrate`` to update the database.

Done! You can now login using the default admin details ``admin@admin.com`` with a password of ``password``. You should change these details immediately after logging in for the first time.
